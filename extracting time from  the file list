10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.


















name = input("enter the file name")
file1 = open(name)
counts = dict()
hours = list()
sorting = list()

for line in file1:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if len(line)<1:
        continue
    if line.startswith("From "):
        section = line.split()
        time = section[5]
        hour  = time.split(":")[0]
       
        hours.append(hour)
        
for word in hours:
    counts[word] = counts.get(word,0)+1
    
for key, value in counts.items():
    sorting.append((key,value))

final =sorted(sorting)

for x,y in final:
    print(x,y)
