9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has sent the greatest number of mail messages. 
The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail. 
The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file.
After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.





















name = input("Enter the file name")
file1 = open(name)
sender = list()
pairs = dict()

for line in file1:
    line = line.rstrip()
    newlist = line.split()
    if len(newlist)<2:
        continue
    if newlist[0] == "From":
        sender.append(newlist[1])
for word in sender:
    pairs[word] = pairs.get(word, 0) + 1
        
maximum_word = None
maximum_value  = None

for key, value1 in pairs.items():
    if maximum_value is  None or value1 > maximum_value :
        maximum_value =value1
        maximum_word = word
print(maximum_word,maximum_value)
