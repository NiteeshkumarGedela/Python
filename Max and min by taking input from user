5.2 Write a program that repeatedly prompts a user for integer numbers until the user enters 'done'.
Once 'done' is entered, print out the largest and smallest of the numbers. 
If the user enters anything other than a valid number catch it with a try/except and put out an appropriate message and ignore the number. 
Enter 7, 2, bob, 10, and 4 and match the output below.


Answer:

largest = 0
smallest = None

while True:
    
    num = input("Enter the number")
    
    if num == "done":
        break
    
    try:
        flo = int(num)
    except:
        print("Invalid input")
        continue
        
    if flo>largest:
        largest = flo
       
    
    
    
    
    if smallest is None:
        smallest = flo
    elif flo<smallest:
        smallest = flo
       
    
print("Maximum is",largest)
print("Minimum is", smallest)
